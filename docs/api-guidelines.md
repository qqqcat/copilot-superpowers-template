# API Guidelines

## Design
- Keep APIs explicit and versionable.
- Use consistent naming and response format.
- Return actionable error messages without leaking internals.

## Validation
- Validate input at boundaries.
- Enforce schema and type constraints.

## Reliability
- Define timeout/retry behavior for external dependencies.
- Include test cases for success, edge, and failure scenarios.
